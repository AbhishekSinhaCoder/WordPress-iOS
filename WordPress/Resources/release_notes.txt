Love apps like iA Writer, 1Writer, Bear, and Ulysses? Move from app to WordPress draft fast â€” the app now imports images from TextBundle and TextPack files and supports importing Markdown files, too.

Notifications for internet connectivity problems no longer eat up your entire device screen. Now thereâ€™s a small popup instead, so you can keep using offline abilities (like deleting posts, which now happens more reliably if youâ€™re offline).

Some text in Activity Log would sometimes show up in a wrong language. Not useful! And now fixed.

Also not useful: crashes. Crashes that sometimes occurred during site creation or when loading stats are resolved.

Jetpack Remote Install is supported, so you can install and activate Jetpack on a self-hosted site right from the app.

Stats are more accessible â€” if you use voiceover in the app, itâ€™ll read your stats to you.
